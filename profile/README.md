<b> *Not just a Loan Comparison site, we get you the cheque also.* </b>

</div>

## Who We Are

At Finance Buddha, we're more than just another online offer comparison site. While we offer an exhaustive range of options, our commitment goes beyond just comparison. We assist you in getting the loan as well.

We understand that financial services aren't like standard e-commerce productsâ€”where cheaper is always better. Each borrower has a unique financial position and requirement. That's why we provide a dedicated sales manager to:

- Advise you on the best bank for your needs.
- Handle initial documentation.
- Answer bank queries on your behalf.
- Negotiate terms for you.
- Complete loan documentation.
- Ensure the disbursal of funds to your account.

Our strength lies in our robust in-house team of 200 professionals spread across 12 cities. Our senior management team consists of industry veterans from banks and NBFCs like Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank, Bajaj Finserve, and GE Money. Thanks to our loyal employees (with an attrition rate of less than 5% over the last 4 years), we are proud to disburse more than â‚¹1,000 crore annually, all within a short span of 4 years.

## Our Vision

We are on an exciting journey to simplify and streamline the financial process for our customers. We are developing proprietary algorithms to provide more incisive suggestions on the best products and banks to choose from.

## What We Do

- **Loan Comparison:** Get access to a comprehensive range of loan offers.
- **Personalized Assistance:** A dedicated sales manager to guide you through the entire process.
